The best way to start is a demo of what we’re going to build together. I’ll walk through some of the
 features of a simple application that enables someone to pick a GPS location, take a picture and
save it with a description locally. A list view will enumerate the pins and allow the user to delete the picture.

We’ll start with a bare-bones GitHub repository that has Redux and React Native setup with a simple
routing library so that we can start diving into some of the challenges with cross-platform mobile development.
We’ll start by looking at how we can handle local application state with Redux and ensuring that we
can build cross-platform components in addition to platform-specific components.

We’ll then take a step back and review how we can leverage an existing mapping library and speak more
generally about what to look for in the React Native eco-system.

After confirming that the mapping library and state management are functioning correctly, we’ll
implement some simple routes to round off the views in our application.

Once we can navigate, store and pin labels on the map, we’ll integrate the device’s camera and
see how we can store binary data in Redux.

I’ll also cover some device-specific considerations for Android and iOS.

At this point (assuming there’s time), I’ll illustrate some of the techniques for bridging code
between Swift and React Native by creating a special “Westernize” button that calls a GPU-accelerated
image manipulation library, transforms the binary image and then issues a callback back to the
React Native application in order to update the redux store.
